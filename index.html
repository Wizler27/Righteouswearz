    <!-- Founder Story -->
    <div class="founder-text">
      <p>
        Clarens “Wiz” McCormick was born in the poorest city in the streets of Haiti. 
        Growing up surrounded by poverty, he developed a strong desire to help those in need.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being adopted to the United States at the age of 7, Wiz was shocked to see 
        that people in America suffered from poverty as well. His faith in Jesus later 
        convicted him to start <strong>Righteous Wearz</strong> with the purpose of earning 
        income to bless the poor and uplift his community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wiz believes that in the Kingdom of God, the greatest are the ones who are humble, 
        least, and poor. Staying kingdom-minded, his passion is to plead the cause of the 
        poor and needy—providing clothing, food, and support to those who are often overlooked 
        but honored in the eyes of God.
